<h4>The technologies and libraries used in this project are as follows:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>React.js</li>
  <li>Next.js</li>
  <li>TailwindCss</li>
  <li>Framer Motion</li>
  <li>Aceternity UI</li>
  <li>Sentry</li>
</ul>

<h4>If the project had continued, an advanced and highly modern project would have been built using many libraries supported by next.js.</h4>

<h5>The reason why I gave up continuing because I had problems with the project files was not to waste time.</h5>
